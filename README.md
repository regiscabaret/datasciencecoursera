# run_analysis.R 
R script produced as Peer Assignment 1 of Getting and Cleaning Data

You may uncomment the first four rows to re-obtain the source data if those are not available in the current folder
Running the script will produce two tidy data sets:
1. One set combining train and test data (in this order) and restricted to measurements at the mean or standard deviation
2. One summary dataset that gives the mean of each measure in the other set by subject and by activity

It also generates a text file containing the first aforementioned tidy data set
